# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

I'm working through it to familiarize myself with Rails 3.1. You're welcome to follow along, but the resulting application isn't likely to be very interesting.
